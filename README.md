## Tuberculosis Detection from Chest X-rays using MobileNetV2 with Spatial and Channel Attention
This repository contains code for research paper TD-Net.

Efficient treatment of tuberculosis (TB) requires timely intervention, which makes it a worrying global health concern. This project aims to automate the detection of TB through chest X-ray images utilizing deep learning. We use an improved MobileNetV2 with attention on spaial and channel dimensions to enhance feature extraction and improve classification accuracy.
